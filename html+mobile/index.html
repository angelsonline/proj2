                <h3>Letter to our Shareholders</h3>
            <p>In 2021, our company continued to successfully execute our strategy and achieve strong operational performance. We are proud of our employees for their commitment to keeping our workplace and the communities where we operate safe throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
            <p>Our strategy has been and continues to be to deliver high return resource growth, a low cost of supply and industry leading cash flow growth. We have built a differentiated portfolio offering a unique value proposition – delivering durable cash flow growth that enables us to invest in some of the highest return projects in the industry and also to grow cash returns to our shareholders.</p>
            <p>In terms of resource growth, we have been disciplined in allocating capital to the best rocks for the best returns. Our portfolio is focused on the Bakken, the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Southeast Asia and Guyana, with its multiple phases of low cost oil developments, and we expect all four of these assets to be free cash flow generative in 2022. Our 2022 capital and exploratory budget is $2.6 billion, of which approximately 80% will be allocated to Guyana and the Bakken. Because of the investments we are making, we are well positioned to significantly lower our cost of supply. By 2026, our cash costs are forecast to decline approximately 25% compared with 2021 to $9 per barrel of oil equivalent. In addition, our portfolio’s breakeven oil price is expected to be one of the lowest in the industry by 2026, decreasing to $45 per barrel Brent. In terms of cash flow growth, we have an industry leading rate of change and durability story. Our company is positioned to grow our cash flow at a compound rate of 25% per year out to 2026 based on a Brent oil price of $65 per barrel.</p>
            <p>Our second offshore development in Guyana, Liza Phase 2, began producing oil in February 2022 and, at capacity, is expected to add more than $1 billion of net operating cash flow annually at $65 per barrel Brent. Following startup, we repaid the remaining $500 million of our term loan, and in March 2022, we announced a 50% increase in our quarterly dividend. As our portfolio becomes increasingly free cash flow positive in the coming years, we commit to return up to 75% of our adjusted free cash flow annually to shareholders by continuing to grow the dividend and accelerating share repurchases.</p>
            <p>Key to our strategy is Guyana, the largest new oil province discovered in the last decade, which is positioned to be one of the highest margin, lowest carbon intensity oil developments in the world according to Wood Mackenzie data. On the Stabroek Block, where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator, we continued our extraordinary string of exploration successes with five significant discoveries in 2021 and two additional significant discoveries in January 2022. Our four sanctioned oil developments on the block have world class economics, with a Brent breakeven oil price of between $25 and $35 per barrel. In 2027, at least six floating production, storage and offloading vessels (FPSOs) are expected to be online on the Stabroek Block with a production capacity of more than 1 million gross barrels of oil per day, with the potential for up to 10 FPSOs to develop the gross discovered recoverable resources of more than 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The Bakken, our largest operated asset, remains an important part of our portfolio with a robust inventory of high return future drilling locations. In 2021, with continued strength in oil prices, we added a second and third rig, which will enable us to accelerate cash flow growth, lower our unit cash costs and further optimize our infrastructure.</p>
            <p>Turning to our 2021 financial results, our adjusted net income was $677 million compared with an adjusted net loss of $894 million in 2020, primarily due to higher realized prices. Cash flow from operations, before changes in working capital, was $3.0 billion, compared with $1.8 billion in the prior year.</p>
