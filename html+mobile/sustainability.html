                <h2>Sustainability</h2>
                <p>Our company’s purpose is to be the world’s most trusted energy partner. This year we will publish our 25th annual sustainability report, demonstrating our longstanding commitment to sustainability and the value we believe it creates for all of our stakeholders.

                    <br><br>Sustainability starts at the top of our company and is reinforced at every level. Our Board of Directors is climate change literate and actively engaged in overseeing Hess’ environment, health, safety and social responsibility (EHS & SR) practices, working alongside senior management.</p>

                <h3>Environment and Climate Change</h3>
                 <p>Climate change is one of the greatest scientific challenges of the 21st century. We believe climate risks can and should be addressed while at the same time meeting the growing demand for safe, affordable and reliable energy, which is necessary to ensure a just and secure energy transition in the context of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
                Governments, businesses and civil society must work together on cost effective policies to meet this dual challenge, and we support transparent carbon pricing as an economically efficient method for managing carbon emissions. We support the aim of the Paris Agreement and a global ambition to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Our climate strategy is closely aligned with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) established by the G20 Financial Stability Board, and its implementation is led by senior members of our leadership
                team with oversight by our Board. As part of our commitment to implement a substantive climate strategy, an executive led taskforce is currently developing a plan for our company to achieve net zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions.

                 <p>Our Board and senior leadership have set aggressive targets for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction. After our company significantly outperformed our five year emissions reduction targets for 2020, we set new five year GHG reduction targets for 2025, which are to reduce operated Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions intensity by approximately 50% from 2017 to 17 kg/BOE and methane emissions intensity by approximately 50% from 2017 to an intensity of 0.19%. We also endorsed the World Bank’s “Zero Routine Flaring by 2030” initiative with a commitment to achieve zero routine flaring from our operations by the end of 2025. These targets are designed
                    to exceed the carbon intensity reductions by 2030 in the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) Sustainable Development and Net Zero Scenarios, which are consistent with the Paris Agreement’s aim to limit the global average temperature rise to well below 2°C.
                    <br><br>
                     Our progress against these new targets will be shared in our sustainability report. Continued flaring reduction, particularly from our Bakken operations, is a key driver for reducing our GHG emissions intensity. For that reason, Bakken flaring reduction was one of the performance metrics in our company’s 2021 annual incentive
                    plan with a target to achieve a 7% flaring rate from our operated Bakken wells and pads as reported to the North Dakota Industrial Commission. We surpassed this target, ultimately reducing our flaring rate to approximately 4% by the end of 2021. As part of our sustainability commitment, we seek to fund innovation to mitigate societal emissions, including the Salk Institute’s Harnessing Plants Initiative, which aims to develop plants with larger root systems that are capable of absorbing and storing potentially billions of tons of carbon per year from the atmosphere. In 2020, we announced a $12.5 million gift to the Salk Institute, and in 2021, we announced another $3 million gift. We also address 100% of the indirect emissions from our purchased electricity through a combination of renewable energy generated from the grid and the purchase of renewable energy certificates.
